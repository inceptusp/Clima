# Clima üå§Ô∏è
  Clima is a weather app made with Apache Cordova and Onsen UI in Brazilian Portuguese.

  It was my first app and the first publicly available, launched on the [Amazon App Store](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B0792HYLQ5/ref=mas_ya_dp) in January 2018. It was removed from the app store in February 2020 due to the turn off of some APIs that it uses and my disinterest in maintaining it.

# This repo
  This repo contains the VS 2015 project files for the Cordova app. Note that it was not updated since 2018 and that Microsoft has dropped the support for Apache Cordova on Visual Studio 2019 onwards. ~~All~~ Most API keys were removed from the code because, although some services have been discontinued and it makes no difference whether or not to hide the keys, others still work today.
